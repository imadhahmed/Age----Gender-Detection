Age and Gender Detector: A Computer Vision Project 🚀
I’m excited to share my latest project, Age and Gender Detector, built using Python and OpenCV!

This tool leverages computer vision techniques to analyze facial features and predict age and gender in real-time, offering a glimpse into the power of AI-driven solutions.

💼 Project Overview
The Age and Gender Detector uses advanced machine learning models and pre-trained datasets to deliver accurate predictions while processing live video feeds or static images.

🔑 Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Processes video streams and identifies faces for age and gender prediction.
High Accuracy: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for reliable results.
Optimized Performance: Built with OpenCV for efficient image and video processing.
User-Friendly: Simple, intuitive interface for easy setup and use.
🛠️ Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your system:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/username/age-gender-detector.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd age-gender-detector
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
Install the required Python libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download Pre-Trained Models
The project relies on pre-trained models for age and gender prediction.
Download the required models (links provided in the repository or README.md) and place them in the models/ directory.
4. Run the Detector
Execute the Python script to start the detector: python age_gender_detector.py
The application will launch, processing your webcam feed by default.
5. Test with Static Images (Optional)
To analyze a specific image, use the following command: python age_gender_detector.py --image path/to/image.jpg
🎉 Learnings and Future Goals
This project was a fascinating journey into the world of computer vision, offering hands-on experience with:

Real-time image processing using OpenCV.
Integrating pre-trained deep learning models for practical applications.
Building AI-powered tools with an emphasis on usability and efficiency.
Looking forward to exploring more AI-driven solutions in future projects! 😊
